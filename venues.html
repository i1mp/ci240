            <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-4"><h1>Sticky Mike's Frog Bar <small>[bar]</h1><br/><p>STICKY MIKE'S is open from 6pm Monday to Saturday with a vast selection of drinks available. From slush puppy cocktails to organic bottled beers, chilled lagers and draft ale. There’s something for everyone... even quality bottles of fizz to suit all budgets. Plus we serve delicious handmade pizzas for a fiver.<br/>The venue is home to a vast array of CLUB NIGHTS run by some of Brighton's best party starters we also host LIVE bands both local and international in our live music space downstairs.<br/>The space has been given it's unique personality by some of our favourite local artists so there's lots to keep you inspired. Plus we have frequent ART happenings upstairs in the bar which always bring a big crowd.</p></div>
            <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-4"><h1>The Mesmerist <small>[bar]</small></h1><p>Ladies and gentlemen, we welcome you to the most unconventional bar in the Brighton Lanes. Inspired by 1930s gin palaces, burlesque and the steampunk movement, we strive to celebrate the best of eras gone by. We cater for a wide age range whilst offering a high standard of service, fantastic food, divine drinks and a jam-packed entertainment schedule. We support live music, and host a variety of bands throughout Sunday to Thursday showcasing vintage and revival inspired acts. Expect anything from a rip-roaring big band with their own swing dancers to a foot stomping one-man blues extravaganza. Weekend evenings are hosted by our resident DJ, spinning vintage classics and boutique rarities. Our famous midnight show on Saturday night never ceases to amaze. Each act is a surprise; watch out for the smoke and the chiming bells. The week finishes with the best roast in town.</p></div>
            <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-4"><h1>Grand Central <small>[bar]</small></h1><p>Directly opposite Brighton Station, Grand Central has a buzzing atmosphere all day and night, providing a perfect stop-off point for travellers to the city and a popular haunt for local residents. Serving food seven days a week, boasting a good range of bourbons, wines and real ales, plus free wi-fi internet access. Our fantastic music selection is based on a love of classic soul and Motown, with occasional DJs perfroming at weekends.

Upstairs is the award-winning Nightingale Theatre, run by the Prodigal Theatre Company; patron Steven Berkoff.</p></div>
            <div class="clearfix visible-xs visible-sm"></div>
            <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-4"><h1>Fiddlers Elbow <small>[bar | food]</small></h1><p>The Fiddler’s Elbow is a thriving traditional Irish pub in the heart of Brighton. Said to serve the best pint of Guinness in the city (and probably the cheapest too).<br/>You’ll find a great selection of whiskies and ales on offer too. They have a big screen for sports, including GAA and 6 Nations Rugby.<br/>There is DJ playing every Saturday night, plus live music 4 nights a week!<br/>Don't forget to try our delicious and hearty pub menu.</p></div>
            <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-4"><h1>Chequers <small>[bar | food | accomodation]</small></h1><p>Take the short drive from Brighton up the A23 to somewhere called Warninglid, following the signs for a tiny little hamlet called Slaugham, and you won’t be disappointed you left the city.  Pronounced “Slaffam” by the locals, the village is as un-touched by the modern world as you will find in Sussex.   With its Norman church, Elizabethan ruins and breath-taking countryside, this beautiful location is also the home of a mysterious little country inn, called The Chequers. Known for the Game Burger food concept that was born there, and for the strange references to game show hosts dotted around the interior, The Chequers is comfortingly incongruous with its surroundings.<br/>When you are handed a giant dice and told to roll a six in order to get you delicious burger for the price of one penny, you realise that you have actually exited reality and you give up trying to make sense of the place.  If the weather is good, just sit back and relax in the stunning garden that looks out over an amazing Mid-Sussex vista.  If the weather is poor, collapse in an armchair next to the fire with a pint of Laine’s Best in your hand.  And when your realise you are lost and have no way of finding your way back to the A23, ask to stay in one of the six boutique bedrooms.</p></div>
            <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-4"><h1>Saint George's <small>[bar]</small></h1><p>A cosy, relaxed, pub tucked away behind Kemp Town village. Stuffed full of memorabilia, and also boasting the coveted green sofa, everyone's welcome in this "cast iron killer local" (The Brighton Source). A selection of well-kept ale is served on rotation, as well as hearty roasts each Sunday. Smokers are kept warm in the 70-seater beer garden at the rear. Children are welcome until 8pm, and baby changing facilities are provided - alongside colouring books and board games. NHS discounts for hospital workers all day every day. </p></div>
